class HookRegistration(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """Interface for session hooks

    Notes
    -----
    Session hooks have to registered in `capellacollab.sessions.hooks.__init__`

    When implementing a specific hook, do not expect positional arguments.
    The hooks are called with keyword arguments only.
    Therefore, unused arguments can be safely ignored via kwargs.

    Unnecessary hooks don't have to implemented and are skipped automatically.
    That's why the hooks in this interface are not abstract methods.
