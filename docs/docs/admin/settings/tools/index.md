# Tools Management

Starting with `v2.0.0`, there is a support for general tools. This allows the
use of many different `Eclipse` based tools (and even more tools if they are
dockerized).

## Managing Tools

The tool management page can be found at `Profile` > `Settings` > `Core` >
`Tools`. It support the following:

- Change the docker images for
  - persistent sessions
  - read-only sessions
  - backups
- Set versions and natures of tools

More information will follow in the future!
