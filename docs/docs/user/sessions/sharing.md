It's possible to share a session with other users. Session sharing can be used
to collaborate with other users on the same session in real-time.

The invited users will get full access to your session and can act on your
behalf. Make sure to trust the entered users and to monitor the session at any
time. The session will be shared until it is terminated. To revoke session
access for a user, terminate your session.

1.  Navigate to your <a href="/" target="_blank">Active Sessions</a>
2.  Find the session and select `Share`.

    !!! warning

        If you don't see the `Share` button, the tool does not support session sharing.

3.  To add users, enter their username in the input field. You add multiple
    users by confirming with `Enter` after each username. The list with users
    will be in the pending state. To invite the users, read and confirm the
    safety information and confirm with `Submit`.
4.  Once shared, the session will appear in the user's active sessions list.
    The invited users can connect to the session as known from own sessions.

    !!! info

        The invited users can't terminate the session or share the session to other users.
