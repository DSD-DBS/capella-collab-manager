# Getting Started with Read-only Project Access

If you have read-only project access, or you simply want to check the model
without risk of editing, you may start a read-only session.

To do so, select the project from the project overview and select the modeling
tool and version from the `Read-only session` section. Next, select the models
you want to load in your read-only session.

Starting read-only session may take a bit of time, depending on the size of the
model and the current load. After the request, the application will fetch the
requested model and change history from git and place it into an empty
workspace. When the loading has finished, you can connect to the session.
