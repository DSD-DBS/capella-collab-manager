# Getting Started with a Persistent Session

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

1. To get started with a persistent session, you have to navigate to
   `Sessions`.
2. Please select the tool and the version you'd like to work with:
    ![Request a persistent workspace](screenshots/request-session.png)
3. You should see your session listed under `Active sessions` on the right.
    ![Active sessions](screenshots/active-sessions.png)

   Session spin-up may take up to 30 seconds before the connection button will
   get enabled. First time start may take up to 1 minute.

4. Click the `Connect` button when it's enabled. A new popup opens, where you
   can select `Connect to Session`. A new browser tab should open and you see
   Capella loading.
