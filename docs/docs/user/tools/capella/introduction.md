# Introduction to Capella

Capella is an Eclipse-based solution for Model-Based Systems Engineering. You
can learn more in the short intro video below:

If you'd like to learn how Capella works you may want to read through our
[guide for meta-model exploration](https://dsd-dbs.github.io/py-capellambse/development/how-to-explore-capella-mm.html)

## Deriving Model-based Products

You may prototype-derived products using Python (Jupyter) and
[py-capellambse](https://github.com/DSD-DBS/py-capellambse). It contains a few
[practical examples](https://github.com/DSD-DBS/py-capellambse/tree/master/examples).

Eventually you may automate production of model-derived documents and other
things via CI/CD pipelines that work on your model git repositories. Get in
touch with your Systems Engineering Toolchain team to learn more.
