# How do I Get Access to a Project?

Please ask a [project administrator](../roles.md) of the specific project for
access. The project administrator can add you as user to the project. After
you've been added, you should have direct access. If you don't see the project
yet, just reload the page with `F5`.

Before a project administrator can add you to a project, you have to log in
once. The first login automatically registers your user in the database.

Your project manager can find more information here:
[Add a user to a project](../add-user/index.md)

You can verify access by navigating to `Projects`. You should see the project
now: ![Project overview](./project-overview.png) If you want to verify if the
persistent session with the TeamForCapella access works, you can follow the
[TeamForCapella workflow](../../tools/capella/teamforcapella/connect/index.md).
The model should be listed in the connection dialog.
