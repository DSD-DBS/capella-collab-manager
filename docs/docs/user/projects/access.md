# How do I get access to a project?

Please ask a [project lead](roles.md) of the specific project for access. The
project lead can add you as user to the project. After you've been added, you
should have direct access. If you don't see the project yet, just reload the
page with `F5`.

Your project manager can find more information here:
[Add a user to a project](add-user.md)

You can verify access by navigating to `Projects`. You should see the project
now: ![Project overview](access/project-overview.png) If you want to verify if
the persistent session with the TeamForCapella access works, you can follow the
[TeamForCapella workflow](../sessions/flows/t4c.md). The model should be listed
in the connection dialog.
