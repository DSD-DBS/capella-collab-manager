# Documentation

Write documentation if necessary so that developer, administrators and users
have an easily accessible way of learning about the collaboration manager.

## Setup and Serve the Documentation

Navigate to the `docs` folder. With the commands `make install` and
`make serve` you can build the documentation and find it served under
`http://127.0.0.1:8081/`. Here you can try your newly written documentation or
search for something yourself.

## Titles

When writing the documentation we are using title case in the
[`Chicago Manual of Style` style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case#Chicago_Manual_of_Style).
In addition personal names/ names of packages are written according to their
documentation.
