# Frontend Testing

**Note:** While frontend testing is valuable, the process of writing and
maintaining such tests can be challenging and time-consuming in certain
instances. Therefore, our team does not require frontend tests for every
component or service. Please ensure that ".spec" files are only included if
they have active tests. Before writing tests, consider the overhead and weigh
it against the potential benefits.

## Unit & Integration Testing

### Technologies

-   We use [Jasmine] as testing framework
-   [Karma] is used as test runner
-   We use [istanbul] to measure and visualize the code coverage

### General

#### Robust Component Tests

When testing components, we must query the elements needed for the test. To
ensure that even if the element type or attributes changes, the element can
still be queried, we assign a `data-testId` to each needed element. This not
only increases robustness, but also makes it very easy to query elements. The
value assigned to the test id should clearly describe the usage of the element
and should not be too long. For example, one can use the schema
`data-testId=<type>-<description>` where the prefix usually describes the
general context (e.g., whether it is an input, button, textfield, etc.) and the
following description specifies the usage of it (e.g., createProject).

#### Element Helper Functions

Usually testing components consists of querying elements, applying changes to
them, triggering events on them, and then comparing the results with the
expected results. To reduce repetition and increase readability, one should use
existing helper functions or create new ones if none exist.

### Executing Tests

To execute the integration tests, one needs to run `make test`. However, in
some cases it is not possible to correctly set the `CHROME_BIN` that is needed
to generate the test output inside the browser. If this is the case, one should
either set the `CHORME_BIN` in the make file or simply run
`EXPORT CHROME_BIN=<path>` followed by `ng test`. Beyond that, it is not
necessary to run anything else (e.g., the backend) for test execution.

#### Output

The resulting output in the browser considers three different cases:

1. Green tests are _successful_ tests
2. Yellow tests (marked with a â˜†) are _deactivated_ tests
3. Red tests are _failed_ tests

The general code coverage statistics (i.e. statement, branch, function, and
line coverage) are output to the console. To also see what exactly is covered
and what is missing, one can open the `index.html` file in the
`/frontend/test-results/istanbul-coverage` folder.

## End-to-End Testing

### Technologies

-   We use [playwright] for E2E testing

### Test Generation

Playwright supports the generation of E2E tests by interacting with the
frontend and recording each action and input. This can be started by executing
`npx playwright codegen localhost:4200` but needs a running frontend and
backend to work.

Test generation can significantly speed up test creation, but in general one
should only use the resulting test as a base and adjust it accordingly. For
example, check selectors and adjust them to make them more robust, or add more
expectations as needed.

### Executing Tests

To run the E2E tests, one must first make sure that a backend is running. If
that is the case, one can run `npx playwright test` to start the tests. In case
of an error the browser will be directly opened and show the last test report,
otherwise one can open it with `npx playwright show-report`. A very helpful
option when running the tests is `--trace on`. This provides, for example, a
screenshot of the action and the before/after state (for each step), contains a
detailed log, and one can also view the console output and network calls
performed.
