## Backend

### General

We base our code style on a modified version of the [Google style guide] for
Python code. The key differences are:

- **Docstrings**: The [Numpy style guide] applies here.

      When writing docstrings for functions, use the imperative style, as
      per [PEP-257]. For example, write "Do X and Y" instead of "Does X and Y".

- **Overridden methods**: If the documentation did not change from the base
  class (i.e. the base class' method's docstring still applies without modification),
  do not add a short docstring รก la "See base class". This lets automated tools pick
  up the full base class docstring instead, and is therefore more useful in IDEs etc.

- **Linting**: Use [pylint] for static code analysis, and [mypy] for
  static type checking.

- **Formatting**: Use [black] as code auto-formatter. The maximum line length is 79,
  as per [PEP-8]. This setting should be automatically picked up from the
  `pyproject.toml` file. The reason for the shorter line length is that it avoids
  wrapping and overflows in side-by-side split views (e.g. diffs) if there's also
  information displayed to the side of it (e.g. a tree view of the modified files).

      Be aware of the different line length of 72 for docstrings. We
      currently do not have a satisfactory solution to automatically apply
      or enforce this.

      Note that, while you're encouraged to do so in general, it is not a hard
      requirement to break up long strings into smaller parts. Additionally, never
      break up strings that are presented to the user in e.g. log messages, as that
      makes it significantly harder to grep for them.

      Use [isort] for automatic sorting of imports. Its settings should automatically
      be picked up from the `pyproject.toml` file as well.

- **Typing**: We do not make an exception for `typing` imports. Instead of
  writing `from typing import SomeName`, use `import typing as t` and access
  typing related classes like `t.TypedDict`.

      Use the new syntax and classes for typing introduced with Python 3.10.

      - Instead of `t.Tuple`, `t.List` etc. use the builtin classes `tuple`, `list`
        etc.
      - For classes that are not builtin (e.g. `Iterable`), `import collections.abc
        as cabc` and then use them like `cabc.Iterable`.
      - Use [PEP-604]-style unions, e.g. `int | float` instead of `t.Union[int, float]`.
      - Use `... | None` (with `None` always as the last union member) instead of
        `t.Optional[...]` and always explicitly annotate where `None` is possible.

- **Python style rules**: For conflicting parts, the [black] code style
  wins. If you have set up `black` correctly, you don't need to worry about
  this though :)
- When working with `dict`s, consider using `t.TypedDict` instead of a more
  generic `dict[str, float|int|str]`-like annotation where possible, as the
  latter is much less precise (often requiring additional `assert`s or
  `isinstance` checks to pass) and can grow unwieldy very quickly.
- Prefer `t.NamedTuple` over `collections.namedtuple`, because the former uses
  a more convenient `class ...:` syntax and also supports type annotations.

### Conventions

#### Imports

1.  Always use `from x import y` or `from x import y as z` when importing modules.
    The only exception is when you are importing a high-level package or module,
    such as `import fastapi`

1.  Given that we often have identical file names across our modules and submodules,
    adhering to the Google style guide can lead to naming conflicts during imports.
    To address this, we distinguish between the following two cases:

    1. _Importing a module from the current directory_: In this case, we
       do not need to rename the module and can use it as is. For instance,
       if we are in `capellacollab.projects.toolsmodels`, we can simply import
       the `crud` and `model` modules like this: `from . import crud, model`.

    2. _Importing a module from a different directory_: In this scenario,
       we must add an `as xy` suffix to avoid naming conflicts with the first case.
       We follow this pattern:

       `from capellacollab.extensions.<extension> import submodule as <extension>_<submodule>`

       For example, if we are in `capellacollab.sessions` and want to import `crud`
       from `capellacollab.projects.toolsmodels`, we would do it like this:

       `from capellacollab.projects.toolmodels import crud as toolmodels_crud`

1.  Only use relative imports up to one level above the current one. This means you
    should use `from . import y` for the current module and `from .. import y as z`
    for one level above. For all other imports beyond this level, use the full path
    as described in 3.

#### Naming conventions

- All SQLAlchemy models should have `Database` as a prefix, e.g.,
  `DatabaseProject` or `DatabaseUser`.

## Frontend

### General

### Naming Conventions

#### Crud Functions

##### Creating resource

For creating a resource one should use `create` as a prefix followed by
the resource one wants to create (e.g., `createProject(...): Observable<Project>`)

##### Retriving resources

In general, one should use `get` as prefix for a function that retrieves and
returns resources.
In case, one wants to get a list of alls resources use `get + <resource type> + s`
as function name (e.g., `getProjects`).
In case, one wants to get a specific resource use `get + <resource type> + By + <property>`
as function name (e.g., `getProjectByName(name: string)`). The only exception
to this rule is the case where one wants to get a resource by its identifier
where the `By + <property>` part can be omitted (e.g., `getProject(id: number)`).

In some services, we use the concept of having a static representation of a resource or
a list of resources as observable inside the service. For example,

```ts
private _gitModel = new BehaviorSubject<GetGitModel | undefined>(undefined);
private _gitModels = new BehaviorSubject<GetGitModel[] | undefined>(undefined);

readonly gitModel = this._gitModel.asObservable();
readonly gitModels = this._gitModels.asObservable();
```

In this case, we use the prefix `load` to retrieve the data but instead of
returning it the data is published to all subscribers. However, the naming
rules from above also apply here (e.g., `loadGitModels` to publish all git models
to the `gitModels` observable and `loadGitModelById` to publish only one git model
to the `gitModel` observable)
