## Release Notes Process

This document outlines the process for managing and publishing release notes
during our development cycle.
The goal of these release notes is to provide clear and user-friendly updates.
The release notes can be found in our user documentation, specifically in `docs/user/release-notes.md`.

Below is our release notes process:

1. During the development cycle, all significant updates, enhancements, and bug fixes
   should be documented in the _Current Release_ section of the Release Notes page.
   This practice ensures that all changes are tracked and can be easily communicated
   to users upon release.
1. Before releasing a new version of the software, the _Current Release_ section
   should be renamed to reflect the actual version number. This step provides a
   clear history of changes for each version, helping users understand
   the changes made in each update.
