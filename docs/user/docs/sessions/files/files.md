    !!! info
            It is currently only possible to upload files with a file size of less than 30MB.
            For larger files we recommend a data transfer via Git.

1. Expand the directories by clicking on the directory icon (1) until you find the directories where you want to
upload your file to. Click the upload button (2) next to the directory name.

      1. When you're ready and selected all files to upload, confirm your
         selection with `Submit`.
      1. The upload can take a few seconds/minutes, depending on the file size.
      1. When the upload was successful, the dialog closes without error message.
