<Title>Welcome to the Storybook of the Capella Collaboration Manager</Title>

This Storybook covers the frontend components of the Capella Collaboration Manager.
We use it for development and visual testing of our components.
A Storybook preview and a change detection using [reg-actions](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-actions)
is created for each pull request on GitHub automatically.

If you want to learn about how to write Stories, have a look at our [development documentation](https://dsd-dbs.github.io/capella-collab-manager/development/frontend/storybook/).
