<Title />

The Project metadata let's users know about the project name, description and status.

When it's loaded, the metadata view looks like:
<Story of={ProjectMetadata.Loading}/>

For example, this is the view for a normal user in the project:
<Story of={ProjectMetadata.NormalUser}/>

Project leads have the option to modify some settings:
<Story of={ProjectMetadata.ProjectAdmin} />

This is how an archived projects looks like:
<Story of={ProjectMetadata.Archived} />

If there are linked models in the project, the delete button is disabled:
<Story of={ProjectMetadata.CantDelete} />
