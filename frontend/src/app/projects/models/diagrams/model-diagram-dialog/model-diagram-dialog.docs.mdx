<Title />

The Model Diagram Cache is currently used as part of the model card.
It provides a preview and the ability to download diagrams from the Capella model.

When the diagrams load, it looks like this:
<Story of={ModelDiagramDialog.Loading}/>

The diagrams are lazy loaded, which means that a diagram that has already
been loaded is already visible. While the diagram is loading, it looks like this:
<Story of={ModelDiagramDialog.DiagramNotLoaded}/>

A single loaded diagram looks like:
<Story of={ModelDiagramDialog.DiagramLoaded}/>

An error may occur when loading a diagram. In this case, the diagram will look like this:
<Story of={ModelDiagramDialog.DiagramError}/>

Because we load the diagrams lazily, different diagrams can be in different states.
Below we see a single view containing three diagrams,
each in one of the previously shown states:
<Story of={ModelDiagramDialog.Combined}/>

If no diagram was found in the remote repository or artifact, it looks like this:
<Story of={ModelDiagramDialog.NoDiagram}/>

Because the capella model can contain a large number of diagrams, it is possible to
search for diagrams. If no diagram is found using the search string, it looks like this:
<Story of={ModelDiagramDialog.NoDiagramForFilter}/>
