The file explorer allows users to browse, download and upload files from their workspace.

While the files are loading, a progress bar is displayed:

<Unstyled>
  <div style={{ width: '400px' }}>
    <Story of={FileBrowserDialog.LoadingFiles} />
  </div>
</Unstyled>

When the files are loaded, a tree is displayed.
Users can expand directories by clicking on the folder icon.

<Unstyled>
  <div style={{ width: '400px' }}>
    <Story of={FileBrowserDialog.Files} />
  </div>
</Unstyled>

## Uploads

When uploading a file, the upload button on the specific directory has to be selected.
The file is then staged for upload. In this story, expand the workspace directory to see the staged file1.

<Unstyled>
  <div style={{ width: '400px' }}>
    <Story of={FileBrowserDialog.UploadNewFile} />
  </div>
</Unstyled>

<Unstyled>
  <div style={{ width: '400px' }}>
    <Story of={FileBrowserDialog.UploadInProgress} />
  </div>
</Unstyled>

When the upload is finished, it's processed by the backend:

<Unstyled>
  <div style={{ width: '400px' }}>
    <Story of={FileBrowserDialog.UploadProcessedByBackend} />
  </div>
</Unstyled>
