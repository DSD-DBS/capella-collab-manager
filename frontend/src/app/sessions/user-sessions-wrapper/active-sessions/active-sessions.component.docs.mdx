<Meta of={ActiveSessions} />

<Title />

The Active Session component shows users information about their current
sessions, including the session type, such as read-only or persistent,
creation type, tool, and connection method, and displays the current session state.

When loading sessions, it looks like this:
<Story of={ActiveSessions.LoadingStory}/>

If there are no active sessions, it looks like this:
<Story of={ActiveSessions.NoActiveStories}/>

If the session starts successfully, it look like this:
<Story of={ActiveSessions.SessionSuccessStateStory}/>

During session creation, when no error has occurred, it looks like this:
<Story of={ActiveSessions.SessionWarningStateStory}/>

If there is an error during creation, it looks like this:
<Story of={ActiveSessions.SessionErrorStateStory}/>

Even though we cover a variety of possible states, the session may end
in an unknown state that looks like this:
<Story of={ActiveSessions.SessionUnknownStateStory}/>

The only difference between a persistent session and a read-only session is the title.
Since we only covered persistent sessions above, this is a read-only session:
<Story of={ActiveSessions.ReadonlySessionSuccessStateStory}/>

## Session sharing

When the tool supports session sharing, the session owner can see a share button:
<Story of={ActiveSessions.SessionSharingEnabled}/>

When the session is shared, the names of users who have access to the session are displayed:
<Story of={ActiveSessions.SessionSharedWithUser}/>

For the user who has access to the shared session, the session looks like this:
<Story of={ActiveSessions.SharedSession}/>
