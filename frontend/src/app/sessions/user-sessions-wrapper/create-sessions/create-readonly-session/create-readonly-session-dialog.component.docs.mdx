<Title />

The Create read-only session dialog lets users select the models they
want to load into their read-only session.

## Large devices

If a model is selected and there is either no limit on the number of
models that can be provisioned or the limit has not been reached, the
"Start Session" button can be used to request the read-only session.
<Story of={CreateReadonlySessionDialog.ModelSelectedAndStartSessionPossible}/>

If there are no models to display, the "Start Session" button is disabled
and a banner is displayed that there are no models with read-only support.

<Story of={CreateReadonlySessionDialog.NoModelsToShow}/>

If the tool only supports a limited number of models that can be deployed
in a single session, and this limit is exceeded, the Start Session button will be
disabled and a banner will appear indicating the maximum number of sessions possible.
